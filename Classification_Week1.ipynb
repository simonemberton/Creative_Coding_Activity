Notebooks can be saved in Google Drive or GitHub and also downloaded to be run locally.  As you can see I've made a new repository in GitHub called AI_for_CT and saved it there.\n",

        "Week 1's task was to come up with an idea for a creative classification task and start putting together a dataset.  The creative task that I've set myself is to subjective image quality assessment, to learn the subjective aesthetic quality of images.  This will be achieved by training a classification network on images and corresponding labels of the human ratings for each image on a scale of 1-5.\n",
